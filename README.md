*note: I haven't been able to do an live test of the full blocklist, jet.

I did test them separately, the list contains over 126 million domains.
My Raspberry Pi 4b, lack of amound ram and storage capacity.
in time I'm going to test with a new 128GB SD card, parsly using it as swap memory.





All credits/acknowledgments goes to the actual developers/sources!
And those who keep the lists up-to-date. 
Please add too the list, if I forgot to mention anyone.
