**note: I haven't been able to fully test the system.
My Raspberry Pi 4b doesn't have enough RAM capacity, and the current SD card was too small.
I'm going to test with a new 128GB SD card, using a part of it as swap memory.

With about a quarter of the blocklist, I already reached over 12 million domains. I expect to exceed 24 million with the full list.

All credits/acknowledgments goes to the actual developers/sources, and those who keep the lists up-to-date. Please add too the list, if I forgot to mention anyone.
